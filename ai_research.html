<h2>Checkpoint 1</h2>
<p>In this checkpoint we present our research questions about the results of the EIT/NMT.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is there a statistically significant difference between the average scores of men and women in basic subjects?</li>
  <li>Do students who took the test abroad have better results?</li>
  <li>Is there a correlation between results in different subjects?</li>
  <li>Which subjects are most often chosen as additional subjects (biology, chemistry, physics, etc.)? </li>
  <li>Is there statistical difference between results in different group ages(17/18 years)?</li>
  <li>What has a stronger impact on EIT/ NMT results: studying at a gymnasium/lyceum or the region of residence?</li>
  <li>Can we predict students' EIT/NMT scores based on school, region, settlement type, and demographic data?</li>
  <li>How has the war in Ukraine affected the educational outcomes of school graduates in different regions,
      including those affected by the war or temporarily occupied, compared to relatively safe regions?</li>
  <li>How has the demand for specific NMT/EІT subjects (such as foreign languages, physics, biology, geography, etc.)
      changed among participants in 2024 compared to previous years?</li>
  <li>Are there any noticeable trends in the increase or decrease in popularity of these subjects?</li>
  <li>Have student grades improved after the school changed from a gymnasium to a lyceum?</li>
  <li>How much better/worse did students do on the NMT than on the EIT?</li>
  <li>Do students who take fewer subjects have a higher average score?</li>
</ol>
